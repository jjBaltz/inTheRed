# inTheRed [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/e435db10-4a55-4a77-8e94-3e9ee81e285e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/inthered/deploys)

inTheRed was created to record in an interactive journal form the way you are feeling per entry. It supplies the user with range sliders to more accurately calculate their moodlet levels - and whether they are in the red and the user should be aware of how frequently they are.
Itâ€™s obviously not fool proof, but it could be the start of the user getting a better identifying eye for themselves in their day to day by asking basic self-care check-ins. Have you eaten recently? Have you had enough water so far in the day? How are you feeling in your body at this moment? Do you feel reclusive and need to talk to someone today?

## About the User
- The ideal user for this application is anyone who would like to practice mindfulness in journaling.
- They have thoughts and feelings about themselves or their situation day to day to then turn into a journal entry or saving a resource they found helpful to their self-care.
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to take breaks, touch base with themselves, identify potential stressors or conflicts that make them feel a certain way, and to catalogue it so that they can come back to it later to see an over-arching dataset of their moodlets.

## Features 
- User Page: the splash profile page will show the a group of four submitted journal entries and two links to immediately create a new entry, or go to the submitted vs drafts folders
- Resources: the user will be able to click into their resources they have found relevant, helpful, or something to save for later 
- Journal Entry Form: the range sliders will help users focus on different moodlet aspects so that they will be better about identifying and associating feelings as well as being able to write about it
- Folders: there is a submitted entries folder for all the entries the user has completed and cannot edit after submittion to save the authenticity of the state of mind of the user, then there are drafts if the user is pulled away for whatever reason and they do not want to lose their work
